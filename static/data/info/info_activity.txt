Physical activity refers to any form of physical exercise that challenges the body and expends energy. It includes activities in which the body's muscles are active and more energy is expended than at rest. Physical activity can range from low intensity such as walking or stretching to high intensity activities such as running or weight training.
There are several types of physical activity, including aerobic exercise, strength training, flexibility exercises, and balance training. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, swimming or cycling, increases heart rate and improves cardiovascular endurance. Strength training involves targeting muscles to build strength, endurance, and musculature. Flexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, improve joint mobility and help keep muscles supple. Balance training aims to improve body stability and coordination to prevent falls.
Physical activity provides a variety of health benefits. It strengthens the cardiovascular system, improves circulation, lowers blood pressure and promotes healthy body composition. Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and certain cancers. It also helps control weight, strengthens bones, joints and muscles, improves mood, reduces stress and increases overall well-being.
