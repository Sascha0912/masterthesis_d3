It includes activities in which the body's muscles are active and more energy is expended than at rest. Physical activity can range from low intensity such as walking or stretching to high intensity activities such as running or weight training. There are several types of physical activity, including aerobic exercise, strength training, flexibility exercises, and balance training. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, jogging, swimming or cycling, increases heart rate and improves cardiovascular endurance. Strength training involves targeting muscles to build strength, endurance, and musculature. Flexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, improve joint mobility and help keep muscles supple. Balance training aims to improve body stability and coordination to prevent falls. Physical activity provides a variety of health benefits. It strengthens the cardiovascular system, improves circulation, lowers blood pressure and promotes healthy body composition. Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity and certain cancers. It also helps control weight, strengthens bones, joints and muscles, improves mood, reduces stress and increases overall well-being."

The back is made up of a complex structure of muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments and discs that work together to keep the body upright and allow movement. Back pain can occur in different areas of the back, including the upper, middle or lower back. There are a variety of possible causes for back pain. The most common include muscle strains or pulls, disc injuries, vertebral fractures, spinal misalignments such as scoliosis, inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, degenerative changes in the spine over time, and poor posture. Additionally, factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor physical fitness, psychological stress, and certain work or daily habits can increase the risk of back pain. Back pain can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Some people experience a dull, persistent pain, while others experience acute, stabbing pain. The intensity of the pain can vary from mild to severe and can also last for a long period of time or occur periodically. In some cases, back pain may also be accompanied by other symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, muscle weakness or limited mobility. Treatment for back pain depends on the underlying cause. In most cases, back pain resolves on its own within a few weeks with conservative measures such as rest, heat applications, physical therapy, stretching exercises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and lifestyle changes such as weight loss, regular exercise and improving posture. However, in some cases, more extensive medical treatment may be needed. This may include medications for pain relief, injections, physical therapy, chiropractic adjustments, acupuncture, or even surgery in rare cases. It is important to consult a doctor if back pain persists, worsens or is accompanied by other serious symptoms."

                infotext = "Stress is a natural response of the body to challenging or stressful situations. It is a state in which the body and mind respond to a demand that is perceived as a threat, challenge, or change. Stress can be triggered by both positive and negative events, such as exams, job demands, financial problems, relationship problems, or traumatic experiences. When we are faced with stress, the body releases hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to prepare the body for increased activity. This response is often called the 'fight-or-flight' response. It mobilizes energy reserves, speeds up the heartbeat, raises blood pressure, and increases concentration in order to respond quickly to the stressful situation. Acute stress is temporary and occurs when we are faced with an immediate threat or challenge. It can help boost performance and motivate us to act quickly. Once the situation is over, the body usually returns to its state of equilibrium. Chronic stress, on the other hand, occurs when the stress continues for an extended period of time and the body does not have an opportunity to recover sufficiently. Chronic stress can have several negative effects on physical and mental health. It can weaken the immune system, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disorders, anxiety and depression, and impair cognitive function."

It describes how effective, restful and undisturbed a person's sleep is. Sleep quality encompasses several aspects, including duration of sleep, efficiency of sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep stages, sleep latency (time required to fall asleep), sleep disturbances, sleep architecture, and subjective perception of sleep. Duration of sleep refers to the total amount of time a person sleeps. It is recommended that adults typically get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night, although individual differences may exist. Sleep efficiency refers to the percentage of actual sleep time relative to total time spent in bed. High efficiency means that the person is actually sleeping a large portion of the time in bed and not lying awake or having restless sleep. Sleep architecture refers to the sequence and distribution of different sleep phases during the night. Sleep consists of recurring cycles of different sleep stages, including deep sleep (slow-wave sleep) and REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep). Good quality sleep includes an adequate amount of deep sleep and REM sleep, as these stages are important for rest, learning, memory consolidation, and emotional regulation."
